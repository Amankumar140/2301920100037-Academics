# Diagonal Traverse  
# Problem Number: #498

## Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The goal is to traverse a matrix in a diagonal order. By grouping matrix elements based on their diagonal index `(i + j)`, we can systematically access the elements in the required diagonal pattern. Additionally, reversing even-indexed diagonals ensures the correct traversal order.

## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Use a HashMap to group matrix elements by their diagonal index `(i + j)`.
2. Traverse the matrix and add elements to their corresponding diagonal groups.
3. Reverse the order of elements in even-indexed diagonals.
4. Concatenate all diagonal groups into a single list.
5. Convert the list into an array and return the result.

## Complexity
*Time complexity:*
- O(m × n), where m and n are the matrix dimensions, as we traverse each element once.

*Space complexity:*
- O(m × n), due to the storage of diagonal groups in the HashMap.

# Matrix Diagonal Sum  
# Problem Number: #1572

## Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The goal is to find the sum of all elements on the primary and secondary diagonals of the matrix. By iterating through the matrix and checking the diagonal conditions, we can efficiently compute the sum.

## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Traverse each element of the matrix.
2. Check if the element lies on the primary diagonal `(i == j)` or the secondary diagonal `(i + j == n - 1)`.
3. If either condition is met, add the element to the sum.
4. Return the computed sum.

## Complexity
*Time complexity:*
- O(m × n), as we iterate through each element of the matrix.

*Space complexity:*
- O(1), as no additional space is required.

# Reshape the Matrix  
# Problem Number: #566

## Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The task is to reshape a matrix into a new shape while preserving the order of elements. This can be achieved by calculating the total number of elements and mapping them to the new dimensions.

## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Calculate the total number of elements in the matrix (`m × n`).
2. Check if reshaping is possible by comparing `m × n` with `r × c`.
3. If reshaping is not possible, return the original matrix.
4. If reshaping is possible, iterate through the elements and map them to the new dimensions.
5. Construct the reshaped matrix and return it.

## Complexity
*Time complexity:*
- O(m × n), as we traverse each element once.

*Space complexity:*
- O(r × c), for storing the reshaped matrix.

# Transpose Matrix  
# Problem Number: #867

## Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The transpose of a matrix swaps its rows and columns. This means the element at position `(i, j)` in the original matrix moves to position `(j, i)` in the transposed matrix.

## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Initialize a new matrix with dimensions swapped (`n × m` for `m × n`).
2. Iterate through the original matrix:
    - Assign the value of `matrix[j][i]` to `transpose[i][j]`.
3. Return the transposed matrix.

## Complexity
*Time complexity:*
- O(m × n), as we iterate through each element of the matrix.

*Space complexity:*
- O(n × m), for storing the transposed matrix.
